# Options Pricer

An options pricing framework in C++ for European, American, and Asian options using analytical and simulation-based methods.

## What’s inside
- European option pricing with the Black–Scholes formula, including dividend adjustments (lump-sum and continuous yield)
- American option pricing with Longstaff–Schwartz least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) and early exercise
- Asian (arithmetic average) option pricing via Monte Carlo simulation
- C++ object-oriented design (inheritance/polymorphism) to keep option types extensible
- Simple command-line interface for interactive pricing and parameter input
